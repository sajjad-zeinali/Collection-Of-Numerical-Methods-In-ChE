# Collection-Of-Numerical-Methods-In-ChE  

This repository contains a collection of representative problems in chemical engineering solved using numerical methods with Python.  
The problems are based on the document:  
**"A COLLECTION OF REPRESENTATIVE PROBLEMS IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING FOR SOLUTION BY NUMERICAL METHODS"**  
This project aims to provide a practical learning resource for applying computational techniques to chemical engineering challenges.

## How to Use This Repository  

The repository is organized as follows:  

- **`Main_Document/`**: Contains the original PDF file of the complete problem set.  
- **`Problem_X/` (e.g., `Problem_1/`)**: Each problem is stored in a separate folder containing:  
  - `solution.py`: The Python code solving the problem.  
  - `Problem_X.pdf`: The specific problem statement extracted from the main document.  

### Steps to Explore:  

1. Browse through the **Main_Document/** folder to view the full problem set.  
2. Navigate to the corresponding `Problem_X/` folder to access:  
   - Python solution (`solution.py`).  
   - The problem statement (`Problem_X.pdf`).  
3. Run the Python scripts locally to explore the solutions.
